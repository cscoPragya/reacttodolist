# reacttodolist
I'm excited to share that I've completed my second task as part of my internship at MyDailyWork. 🎉 This time, I built a React Todo List application that comes with some essential functionalities:

✅ Add new tasks
📝 Edit existing tasks
❌ Delete tasks
💾 Store tasks in Local Storage for persistent data even after a page refresh

This project helped me dive deeper into React fundamentals, including state management, component structure, and integrating browser storage effectively.
